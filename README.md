# Solidity Learning Roadmap

A structured roadmap documenting my progression from Solidity fundamentals to advanced security, optimization, and real-world protocol development.

---

## Level 1: Basics 

- Core Solidity types: uint, address, bool
- Data structures: mapping, struct
- Function types: view, pure, payable
- Global variables: msg.sender, msg.value, block.timestamp
- Security basics: Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern

---

## Level 2: Professional Solidity

- Events and logging for frontend integration
- Contract inheritance using `is`
- Visibility: private, internal, external
- Role-based access control
- Interfaces and contract composability
- Development tooling: Foundry / Hardhat

---

## Level 3: Security and Optimization

- Gas optimization techniques
- Fixed-point math and decimal handling
- Common smart contract vulnerabilities:
  - Reentrancy
  - Front-running
  - Oracle manipulation
- Extensive unit testing with Foundry
- Upgradeable contracts and proxy patterns

---

## Level 4: Portfolio and Ecosystem

- DeFi protocol fundamentals (DEXs, lending, stablecoins)
- Portfolio projects:
  - DeFi protocol (lending or exchange)
  - NFT marketplace or advanced minting system
  - DAO governance system
- Open-source contributions

---

## Goal

To become a production-ready smart contract engineer with strong security fundamentals and real-world protocol experience.
